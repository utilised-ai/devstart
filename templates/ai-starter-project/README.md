# AI Starter Project ðŸ¤–

This project is designed to be perfect for coding with AI assistance!

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# Or use development mode (auto-restart)
npm run dev
```

## Project Structure

```
ai-starter-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.js      # Main server file
â”œâ”€â”€ public/           # Static files (HTML, CSS, images)
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      # Project configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md         # This file!
â”œâ”€â”€ CLAUDE.md         # AI context file
â””â”€â”€ .cursorrules      # Cursor AI rules
```

## Working with AI Assistants

This project is optimized for AI-assisted development:

1. **Clear Comments**: Every section is well-commented
2. **Simple Structure**: Easy for AI to understand and modify
3. **TODO Markers**: Shows where to add new features
4. **Context Files**: CLAUDE.md and .cursorrules help AI understand your needs

## Example AI Prompts

Try these prompts with your AI assistant:

### Adding Features
- "Add a route to get the current time"
- "Create a simple todo list API"
- "Add a contact form endpoint"

### Frontend
- "Create a simple HTML page in the public folder"
- "Add a form that posts to /api/contact"
- "Make a button that fetches from /api/hello"

### Database
- "Add SQLite to store user data"
- "Create a simple JSON file database"
- "Add MongoDB connection"

### Authentication
- "Add basic username/password login"
- "Create a simple API key system"
- "Add JWT authentication"

## Tips for AI Coding

1. **Be Specific**: "Add a POST route to /api/users that saves a name and email"
2. **Ask for Explanations**: "Explain how this route works"
3. **Request Best Practices**: "Is this secure? How can we improve it?"
4. **Iterate**: "Can you make the error messages more user-friendly?"

## Common Commands

```bash
# Run the server
npm start

# Development mode (auto-restart)
npm run dev

# Format code
npm run format

# Check for errors
npm run lint

# Run tests (once you add them!)
npm test
```

## Next Steps

1. Open this project in Cursor or VS Code
2. Start the server with `npm run dev`
3. Ask AI to help you add features!
4. Have fun building! ðŸŽ‰

Remember: There's no wrong way to learn. Experiment, break things, and ask AI to help you fix them!
