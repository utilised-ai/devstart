## What You Just Installed

Think of your new setup like a fully equipped kitchen:

- **VS Code** = Your cutting board (where you write code)
- **Node.js/Python** = Your ingredients (programming languages)
- **npm/yarn** = Your grocery store (download code others have made)
- **Git** = Your recipe book (save your work)
- **Databases** = Your refrigerator (store data)

## Your First Project

### Option 1: Simple HTML Website (Easiest)

1. Open Terminal
2. Type these commands one by one:
```bash
cd ~/Dev/projects
mkdir my-first-website
cd my-first-website
code .
```

3. In VS Code, create a new file called `index.html`
4. Copy this code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            text-align: center;
            padding: 50px;
            background-color: #f0f0f0;
        }
        h1 {
            color: #333;
        }
        button {
            padding: 10px 20px;
            font-size: 16px;
            cursor: pointer;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My First Website!</h1>
    <p>This is my first web page. Pretty cool, right?</p>
    <button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click Me!</button>
</body>
</html>
```

5. Save the file (Cmd+S)
6. Right-click the file in VS Code and select "Open with Live Server"
   (If you don't see this option, install the "Live Server" extension)

### Option 2: Interactive JavaScript Project

1. Open Terminal
2. Create a simple to-do app:
```bash
cd ~/Dev/projects
npx create-react-app my-todo-app
cd my-todo-app
npm start
```

3. Your browser will open automatically!
4. Edit `src/App.js` to see changes live

## Common Beginner Questions

### Q: "What's Terminal?"
**A:** It's like texting with your computer. Instead of clicking, you type commands.

### Q: "What's the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?"
**A:** JavaScript is the language. Node.js lets JavaScript run on your computer (not just in browsers).

### Q: "Do I need to memorize all these commands?"
**A:** No! Even experienced developers Google commands daily. Keep this guide handy.

### Q: "What should I build first?"
**A:** Start simple:
- Personal website
- Calculator
- To-do list
- Weather app (using free APIs)

### Q: "How long until I can build real apps?"
**A:** With consistent practice:
- 1-2 months: Simple websites
- 3-6 months: Interactive web apps
- 6-12 months: Full applications

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Fixes

#### "Command not found"
```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
Then try the command again.

#### "Permission denied"
Add `sudo` before your command:
```bash
sudo [your command]
```

#### VS Code won't open from Terminal
1. Open VS Code manually
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P`
3. Type "Shell Command: Install 'code' command"
4. Press Enter

#### npm/yarn errors
Try clearing the cache:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

#### "Port already in use"
Another app is using that port. Try:
```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill
```

### Still Stuck?

1. **Google the error message** - Copy the exact error and search
2. **Stack Overflow** - Where developers help each other
3. **Reddit** - r/learnprogramming is very beginner-friendly
4. **Discord** - Join coding communities
